Pilot instruction module interface:

- Init
- Get Data, returns NULL if no new data available, returns the data struct if new data is available.
- #defines in the header to cover max angles


Workings:
An ISR that is in another file puts a timestamp into the pilot instructions module by calling one of it's functions. (that function also decides wether it was a rising or falling edge).
Nothing else happens until Controller starts calling do, at which point the data is processed. When that is finished, the do function returns success and Controller may collect the data.



#receiver info:

- Pwm signals have a period of 20 ms.
- They are active high for anywhere from 1-2 ms.
- One happens right after the other so that all channels have sent info ~12ms after the first pulse.
