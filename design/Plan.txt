milestones:

1. Making sure the timing is correct and that correct info gets passed via I2C in simulation.
2. Outputting the exact same pwm delivered by throttle channel of the receiver to the motors with unseable lag.
3. Adding bank, pitch and yaw and making sure correct output is processed in simulation.
4. Testing on the actual board, with the actual quad.
5. Read from both sensors in a timely manner, make sure all info has time to be processed.
6. Output only Sensor data to the quad, making sure the Sensor algorythims behave properly.
7. Combine Sensor and pilot data in Simulation
8. Verify output in real life. 



Phase 1: All motors conrolled in unison, with the computer reading only the throttle channel and outputting the same signal to all 4 channels.      [Completed]

Phase 2: Roll, pitch, and yaw incorporated into the segnals sent by the computer to the motors, full controlability available to the pilot.			[Completed]

Phase 3: Sensor data incorporated into the signals to cosistently keep the quad leve, wether or not pilot gives any input.
	a. Deliver only accelerometer data to the quad.
	b. combine accelerometer and pilot data.
	c. Combine accelerometer, gyroscope and pilot data.
