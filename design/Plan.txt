milestones:

1. Making sure the timing is correct and that correct info gets passed via I2C in simulation.
2. Outputting the exact same pwm delivered by throttle channel of the receiver to the motors with unseable lag.
3. Adding bank, pitch and yaw and making sure correct output is processed in simulation.
4. Testing on the actual board, with the actual quad.
5. Read from both sensors in a timely manner, make sure all info has time to be processed.
6. Output only Sensor data to the quad, making sure the Sensor algorythims behave properly.
7. Combine Sensor and pilot data in Simulation
8. Verify output in real life.
