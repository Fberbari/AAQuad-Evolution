-Init
- send: returns Succeeded or failed.


Workings:

an array of 4 numbers 0-100 that represent the requested motor strength is passed in. The module translates
that into pwm chip language and sends it via I2C to the chip. This has to be a blocking call and it must complete before the next pilot input comes through.
