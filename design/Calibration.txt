	2. if pilot raises throttle, go to try saving calibration.					P
	3. Wait until Pilot Lowers Throttle.										P
	3. In saving a calibration, correct data is gathered from the sensors.		P
	4. It is written to eeprom.													P
	5. In loading calibration, correct data is gathered from eeprom.			P
	6. In loading calibration, correct dta is written to the module.			P

Caveats:
	1. It is quite possible that the very first pilot reading is the one used. does this work ?		P
